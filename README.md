# mapbox-coffee-places

This app implements a simple map with markers and the Places plugin with a search dialogue box. The markers are located in San Francisco, CA and they represent coffee shops in proximity to MapBox HQ. The saved places are markers of my favorite coffee shops in Seattle.


This app has been tested on a physical device: the Pixel 3.

To run this app, you will have to create an access token and a secret key with the `Downloads:Read` scope.

The access token can be populated in `res/values/strings.xml`. The secret key can be populated in your gradle directory, under `grader.properties`.
